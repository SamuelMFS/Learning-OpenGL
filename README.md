# Learning-OpenGL

A simple OpengGL test with GLFW using the code provided by GLFW org on [https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html#quick_example](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html#quick_example).

To test it simply run in cmd:


>cmake -S . -B ./build <br>
>cmake --build ./build

Once the code is fully compiled just type in cmd:


>./build/test


This should create a window and render a rotating RGB triangle inside it.  
To close simply press Escape.
