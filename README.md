# Learning-OpenGL

A study of OpenGL with Glad and GLFW following the steps on [OpenGL Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45MIykWJ-C4).

To test it simply go to the root file of the repository and type in the cmd:

>. scripts/envsetup.sh 

>config

>build

Once the code is fully compiled just type in cmd:

>run

This should create a window and render a navy-blue background with an orange shape inside it.
